This test is a port of http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/away3d-starling-interoperation.html

It has few differences, I wanted to test feather interoperation too so there's a feather button instead of the easy flash one.

The purpose of the example is to ensure that all libraries works together.
